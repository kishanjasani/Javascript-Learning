Primitive datatype : Means this all are not object.
=========================================================
Number:    Floating point numbers, for decimals and integers.
String:    Sequence of characters, used for text.
Boolean:   Logical data type that can only be true or false.
Undefined: Data type of a variable which does not have a value yet.
Null:      Also means 'non-existent'.

Javascript has dynamic typing :- means we do not have to declare variable type.

History of Javascript : 

1996: Changed from livescript to javascript to attract java developers.

1997: ECMAScript 1 became the first version of the javascript language standard:
* ECMAScript: The language standard;
* JavaScript: The language in practice.

2009: ECMAScript 5 (ES5) was released with lots of new features.

2015: ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) was released: the biggest update ever.

2015: ECMAScript 2016 (ES2016) was released with minor changes.

ES5 : 
    *   Fully supported in all modern browsers.
    *   Ready to be used today (2016).

ES6/ES2015 :
    *   Only partial support in modern browsers, no support in older browsers;
    *   Can't use it in production today.

ES2016 :
    *   Almost no support in modern browsers;
    *   Can't use it in production today.

Why we are using ES5 :
    *   ECMAScript 2015 still has very incomplete browser support today.
    *   When working on older codebases, these will be written in ES5.
    *   it's easier to learn ES5 and then upgrade to ES6/ES2015.

How javascript works behind scenes : Javascript parser and engine
    *   


    OUR CODE  ====>  JAVASCRIPT ENGINE (Spider monkey, Google's v8 engine that is using google chrome.)

In Javascript engine first thing happnes is -> Parser( Which reads our code line by line and checks if the syntax of the code that we gave it is correct. ) Abstract syntax tree -> If every thing is currect than parser produces a datastructure know as the abstract syntax tree. which transalte into
                                                    -> Machine code -> so this code is no longer javascript code and that code is directly converted to computer or processor.
                                                            -> Code runs

=> Execution contexts and the execution stack :
    *   Execution contexts :
        =>  All JS code needs to run in environment & this environment is called Execution contexts.
        => A box or container, or a wrapper which stores variables and in which a piece of our code is evaluted and executed

    => The Default Execution context is the GLOBAL Execution contexts.
        ->  Code that is not inside any function.
        ->  Associated with the global object.
        ->  In the browser, that's the window object.

        lastName === window.lastName;   //true

****************************************************************************************************************************
                                                    Global Execution Context
****************************************************************************************************************************

var fname = 'Kishan';

function first() {
    var a = 'Hello!';
    second();
    var x = a + fname;
    console.log( x );
}

function second() {
    var b = 'Hii!';
    third();
    var y = b + fname;
    console.log( y );
}

function third() {
    var c = 'Hey!';
    var z = c + fname;
    console.log( z );
}

first();

================================================================================================================
        Execution stack
        ----------------
                |
    Global Execution context
                |
    Execution Context `first()(Function name)`
                |
    Execution Context `second()(Function name)`
                |
    Execution Context `third()(Function name)` => Once the execution is finished then it will be remove from the top of the stack.

Execution Context in detail: CREATION and EXECUTION phases and hoisting

Execution Context object :- 
    ->  Variable object 
    ->  Scope chain
    ->  'This' Variable 

1.  Creation phase
    a)  Creation of the Variable Object
    b)  Creation of the scope chain
    c)  dETERMINE VALUE OF THE 'this' variable

2.  Execution phase
    The code of the function that generated the current execution context is ran line by line.

a)  Creation of the Variable Object : 
    The argument object is created, containing all the arguments that were passed into the function.
    Code is scanned for function declarations: for each function, a property is created in the Variable Object, pointing to the function.   | Variable Hoisting
    Code is scanned for Variable declarations: for each variable, a property is created in the Variable Object and set to undefined.        | Variable Hoisting

Hoisting :-
